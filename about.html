        <h1>Programming History</h1>

        <p style = "margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">
            In 2017, Chris was introduced to <a href = "https://www.code.org">code.org</a>, an online learning platform designed to help teach
            people basic programming. After getting hooked on programming with JavaScript, he began creating simple apps and games, with the 
            <u>What's The Answer</u> series becoming quite popular, with the 5th entry being played over 30,000 times. The series as a whole had
            nine games, with a tenth one planned but put on hold indefinitely. He recieved an award for his JavaScript projects.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style = "margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">
            After doing that for a few years, Chris then went on to create games using <a href = "https://www.scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>, which
            is another simple platform for people of all ages to learn how to code. He created a few advanced projects on the platform, such as 
            an RPG game, and <u>Cube Survive: The Other Sides</u>. By the end of the run, over 40 projects were shared online.
        </p>

        <p style = "margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">
            In 2022, Chris was introduced to and immediately mastered Python. He began to focus more on practicality, and made Python programs
            that would either be useful to people or help him improve his skills. In a single weekend, he wrote a 500 line banking system, which
            creates and saves accounts to a file and keeps record of all transactions, and much more (<a href = "https://www.github.com">
            Github Repository</a>) just to see if he could do it. He used pygame to create a <u>Super Mario</u> style platformer, which he also
            recieved an award for.
        </p>

        <p style = "margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">
            Currently, he is studying Software Development with Keyin College to further improve his skills. During that time, he was employed
            by Community Sector Council Newfoundland and Labrador as a trainer to help promote digital literacy in the central region of the 
            province. As well, he made a small fortune doing a few websites for local businesses and individuals.
