                    Christopher Higgins (Commonly referred to as Chris) is a programmer who recieved an award for his work with Python and 
                    game development. Currently, he is studying software development with Keyin College after recieving the digital workforce
                    scholarship. <br>
                    <br>
                    Getting hooked on programming at age 13, Chris developed the passion after using code.org to make simple apps using JavaScript.
                    He continued to use JavaScript for several more years, crafting together a game series called <u>What's The Answer</u>, with
                    the 5th game in the series being played over 30,000 times. <br>
                    <br>
                    He later followed this passion for game development, and picked up Scratch, where he worked on multiple other projects on the
                    platform. Later on, he focused on practicality, and began learning Python, which he continues to use even now. <br>
                    <br>
                    Despite this new focus on practicality, Chris still works on video games to this day, with his current project being
                    <u>Savior</u>, planned to release by the end of 2024. It's created using the Pygame library for Python. <br>
                    <br>
                    Outside of programming, Chris enjoys watching reality competition shows such as <u>Big Brother</u> or <u>Survivor</u> in the
                    evening, and playing the occasional video game every once in a while, that being most recently <u>The Legend of Zelda</u>.

            <u>Cube Survive 2</u>, the next game in the series, is a project Chris has been working on for roughly 4 years now, with a hopeful
            release of this summer. <br>
            <br>
            In this project written in python and being ported over to Scratch at the same time, you can explore a sidescrolling world in many
            different settings, such as a normal grassland, a city, a swamp, and more! The goal is to help other areas and communities with
            various problems, such as an overcrowding of monsters, or being a poorer area. <br>
            <br>
            Sometimes, the only solution to a problem can be found underground. In the dungeons, you can find power-ups, and ore that you can
            sell. However, you'll also find dangerous enemies, such as the brand new <u>Stalker</u>, who lurks in the underground chasms.
